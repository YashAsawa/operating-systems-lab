# Operating Systems Class C++ Projects

This directory contains the C++ projects I created for the labs within the NYU Operating Systems classes. Each lab folder contains an assignment to simiulate some portion of a unix operating system using C++. Note that this class was my first forray into the use of C++ and low-level languages, therefore the first few labs contain common error and mistakes, which improve over the course. 

Each of these assignments and the included lab descriptions were created by NYU Professor Hubertus Franke.

## Lab 1: Linker
This lab simulated the creation of a linker to link relative memory locations of multiple modules into a single executable. `linker.cpp` contains the C++ code and `lab1-linker-fall2018.pdf` explains the assignment in detail.

## Lab 2: Scheduler
This lab simulated an operating system's thread/process scheduler using an array of different scheduling schemes. `scheduler.cpp` contains the C++ code and `lab2-sched-fall2018.pdf` explains the assignment in detail.

## Lab 3: Virtual Memory Management
This lab simulated an operating system's virtual memory management unit. `mmu.cpp` contains the C++ code and `lab3-mmu-fall2018.pdf` explains the assignment in detail.

## Lab 4: IO Scheduler
This lab simulated an operating system's IO scheduler of reading blocks from a disk. `iosched.cpp` contains the C++ code and `lab4-iosched-fall2018.pdf` explains the assignment in detail.
